    "boolean: the type of the built-in values True and False. Useful in conditional expressions, and anywhere else you want to represent the truth or falsity of some condition. Mostly interchangeable with the integers 1 and 0. In fact, conditional expressions will accept values of any type, treating special ones like boolean False, integer 0 and the empty string \"\" as equivalent to False, and all other values as equivalent to True. But for safetyâ€™s sake, it is best to only use boolean values in these places.\n",
